To start app:
$npm install --save
$webpack
$npm start
- Go to localhost 8080

**********************
- Redux serves to construct the application state and React provides the views to display.

**********************
- Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications. Aka (A collection of all the data that describes the app)
- What it means is:
a) Redux takes care of the data layer of an application, b) React will take of the view layer of an application

- The difference from Angular, Backbone etc?
- With Redux we centralize all the the app's data inside of a single object. Which refer to as the application level state.

- Application Level State:
a) Is the app as a whole, a global object that contains all the data of our application.

***************************************************************************************************************************
- Redux keeps track of the current state of the app, and the data that tells a component what and how they should render.
***************************************************************************************************************************


*****************
- Reducers:
- A reducer is a function that returns a piece of the application state. It producers the value of the app's state
- Since an app can have many different pieces of state, therefore we can have many different reducers.


*****************
- Wiring Redux to React
//React and Redux are two separate libraries, through the use of 'react-redux' library we are able to wire the two together


*****************
- Container
//A container is a react component that has a direct access to the state managed by redux

**********************
- Container and State
//In general we want the most parent component that cares about a particular state to be a container.
//Only the most parent component that uses a particular piece of state needs to be connected to Redux.
//Whenever we forge a connection between a component and Redux, it turns that component into a container.


**********************
- connect()
//connect takes a function and a component and produces a container

**********************
- Redux serves to construct the application state and React provides the views to display.


**********************
- Actions Creators
//Changing our state is what actions and actions creators are for.
//Action Creators is a function that returns an action.
//The actions just flow through our different reducers. Reducers can then use that action to produce a different value for its particular state.
//In the book list ex the action creator returns an object, the object has a type and some data that further describes the action.


************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
- Redux helps separate the DATA consumed by an app from the VIEW used to display the app.
- Redux steps in as the DATA layer of the app, whereas React becomes the VIEW layer of the app.
- We centralize all the app data inside of a SINGLE object also referred as application level STATE.
- Redux contains the state of an app and the data that tells a component how and what they should render.

- Reducer is a function that returns a piece of the app state

- A container is a React component that has a direct connection to the state managed by Redux.
- In general we want the most parent component that cares about a particular piece of state to be a container
- Only the most parent component that cares about a particular piece of state needs to be wired to Redux.
- Whenever we forge a connection between a component and Redux, it turns that component into a container.

- Actions and Action Creators are for changing state
- Action Creator is a function that returns an action/object
- ALL Actions flow through ALL Reducers.
- Reducers can choose to return a diff piece of state, depending on the Action (hences SWITCH statement).
- A Reducer doesn't have to react to every Action if the same is has no relation to the given Reducer, therefore this Reducer will just return its
current state without changes.
