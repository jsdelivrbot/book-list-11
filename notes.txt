- Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications. Aka (A collection of all the data that describes the app)
- What it means is:
a) Redux takes care of the data layer of an application, b) React will take of the view layer of an application

- The difference from Angular, Backbone etc?
- With Redux we centralize all the the app's data inside of a single object. Which refer to as the application level state.

- Application Level State:
a) Is the app as a whole, a global object that contains all the data of our application.

***************************************************************************************************************************
- Redux keeps track of the current state of the app, and the data that tells a component what and how they should render.
***************************************************************************************************************************


*****************
- Reducers:
- A reducer is a function that returns a piece of the application state. It producers the value of the app's state
- Since an app can have many different pieces of state, therefore we can have many different reducers.


*****************
- Wiring Redux to React
//React and Redux are two separate libraries, through the use of 'react-redux' library we are able to wire the two together


*****************
- Container
//A container is a react component that has a direct access to the state managed by redux

**********************
- Container and State
//In general we want the most parent component that cares about a particular state to be a container.
//Only the most parent component that uses a particular piece of state needs to be connected to Redux.
//Whenever we forge a connection between a component and Redux, it turns that component into a container.


**********************
- connect()
//connect takes a function and a component and produces a container
